Project Introduction\n<br/>\n\nIn this project, I mainly explore and discuss the relationship between group diversity and outcomes in GitHub projects. Based on the first paper I listed in my bibliography, I refer to its measurable variables and analysis model for Wikipedia datasets. Then combining with the second paper, I make some adjustments for GitHub groups.\n\nI consider the effects of diversity from two aspects, tenure diversity and country diversity. They are also the independent variables. The tenure diversity of a project group is the coefficient of variation of Ti for all its members. Ti is tenure of each member which is defined as the number of days from the first event of a quarter (a 90-day period) to the end of the quarter. To get the coefficient of variation, we also need the mean value of members' tenure. For country diversity, we will firstly calculate the percentages of group members from each country. Then use Blau index to express the country diversity of this group. \n\nIn this project, the corresponding dependent variables are group productivity and member withdrawal. We use the number of events from all group members to measure group productivity. Events here include pull-requests, commits, comments and issues. Member withdrawal of a project group is obtained from the difference of the number of members who have activities in this quarter and that of last quarter.\n\nThere are also some controlled variables that may have potential influnence on response variables like quarter index and project size. Quarter index will be included within tables of response variables to show their change among different quarters. Project size is defined as the number of members in the project. We will build its dataframe seperately.\n\nThe data source of my project is the GHTorrent datasets on Google Bigquery. According to definitions of variables stated above, I list the datasets and attributes chosen of this project in the data preparation section. After selecting and filering data on Bigquery, I export the prepared data as .csv files and download to local through Jupyter. Then upload them to Google drive. Next, import the data to Spark RDD form and transform to dataframes for building dataframes and fitting models.\n\nThe model in the original paper is Hierarchical Linear Model (HLM) which is an advanced form of linear regression that allows us to examine the effects of independent variables (diversity) on dependent variables (outcomes), taking into account potential correlations. They implement the analysis with lme4 package in R. But in Spark machine learning library, there is no model directly corresponding to HLM model. So, I choose the mostly related one in machine learning library in Spark -- generalized linear model (GLM) to achieve this project. We can set different features when analyzing the relation between a pair of variables. Then fit the model to our dataset. And based on the summary of generalized linear model, we can interpret the results and get conclusions.

Basic Questions to Assess Data Scope.\n\n- Given the granularity of the dataset, what characteristics of the thing represented by the records are captured by the record fields? What characteristics are not captured?\n\n  Given the granularity of dataset, the record fields can represent members, projects and events. From the GHTorrent schema, we can also realize some relations between two datasets. For example, the id attribute in commits dataset responds to the commit_id in commit_comments dataset. Some information is not captured by the record fields like gender of users, the update status of members in a projects.\n  \n\n\n- For the analysis that you want to perform, can you deduce or infer additional relevant characteristics from the ones that you have?\n\n  From the ghtorrent dataset, we can obtain basic attributes of datasets. Then in later analysis, we can use prepared data to infer the independent and response variables in my project. For example, in order to calculate the tenure diversity of members in a project, we need tenure of each member and their mean value. Each member's tenure in a quarter is defined as the number of days from the first event to the end of the quarter. So we need to combine event tables and group by projectId and memberId to show all events from each member in each project. Then get tenure of each member to calculate the tenure diversity.\n\n\n- Are there multiple records for the same thing? If so, does this change the granularity of your dataset or require some amount of deduplication before analysis?\n\n  Multiple records can be likely to give more additional details or information about a same thing.

From the GHTorrent schema, we can also realize some relations between two datasets. For example, the id attribute in commits dataset responds to the commit_id in commit_comments dataset. Some information is not captured by the record fields like gender of users, the update status of members in a projects.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>For the analysis that you want to perform, can you deduce or infer additional relevant characteristics from the ones that you have?</p>\n<p>From the ghtorrent dataset, we can obtain basic attributes of datasets. Then in later analysis, we can use prepared data to infer the independent and response variables in my project. For example, in order to calculate the tenure diversity of members in a project, we need tenure of each member and their mean value. Each member's tenure in a quarter is defined as the number of days from the first event to the end of the quarter. So we need to combine event tables and group by projectId and memberId to show all events from each member in each project. Then get tenure of each member to calculate the tenure diversity.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Are there multiple records for the same thing?
